# Cashew App FAQ Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for the Cashew app. The FAQ page serves as a resource for users to find answers to common questions about the app's features, functionality, and usage.

## FAQ Page Location

Based on the codebase analysis, the Cashew app's FAQ page is hosted at:

```
https://cashewapp.web.app/faq.html
```

This URL is referenced consistently throughout the codebase in various files.

## FAQ Page Integration in the App

The FAQ page is integrated into the Cashew app in several ways:

1. **Settings Page**: There is a link to the FAQ page in the app's settings page, labeled according to the user's language preference.

2. **About Page**: The FAQ page is linked from the About page with the label "FAQ, Guides, and Help".

3. **Premium Page**: There's a specific link to the FAQ section about restoring purchases at `https://cashewapp.web.app/faq.html#restoring-purchases`.

4. **Import CSV Feature**: When using the CSV import feature, there's a link to a specific FAQ section at `https://cashewapp.web.app/faq.html#import-csv-data`.

5. **Rating Popup**: The FAQ page may be linked from the app's rating popup dialog.

## User Settings Control

The visibility of FAQ links in the app is controlled by a user preference setting:

```dart
"showFAQAndHelpLink": true
```

This setting can be toggled in the debug page of the app, allowing users to show or hide FAQ-related links throughout the interface.

## Localization

The FAQ page links and labels are fully localized. The translation keys include:

- `"guide-and-faq"`: Translated to "FAQ, Guides, and Help" in English and appropriate equivalents in other languages
- `"faq"`: Translated to "FAQ" in English and appropriate equivalents in other languages

The app supports numerous languages, and the FAQ-related text is translated for each supported language.

## FAQ Content Topics

Based on the specific anchors referenced in the codebase, the FAQ page likely covers at least the following topics:

1. **Restoring Purchases**: Information about how to restore premium purchases
2. **Importing CSV Data**: Instructions for importing transaction data from CSV files

## Implementation Notes

- The FAQ page appears to be a static HTML page hosted on Firebase Hosting
- The page likely uses anchors (e.g., `#restoring-purchases`) to allow direct linking to specific sections
- The feature was added as part of the app's changelog, mentioned as "FAQ, Tips, and Guide website link on More page"

## Recommendations for Documentation

1. **Content Capture**: Since direct web access attempts to the FAQ page were unsuccessful in our analysis environment, it's recommended to manually visit the page and document its contents for completeness.

2. **Structure Documentation**: Create a structured outline of the FAQ page's sections and topics for reference.

3. **Screenshot Archive**: Maintain screenshots of the FAQ page for reference in case the online version changes.

4. **Update Process**: Document the process for updating the FAQ page content, including any Firebase deployment steps.

## Conclusion

The FAQ page is an important support resource for Cashew app users. It's integrated throughout the app interface and provides guidance on key features and common issues. Proper documentation of this resource will help maintain and improve the user support experience.

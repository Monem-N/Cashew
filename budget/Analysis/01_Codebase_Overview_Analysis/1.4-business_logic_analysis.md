# Cashew App Business Logic Analysis

## 1. Overview

The business logic of the Cashew app is primarily implemented in the `struct` directory, which contains a collection of utility functions, data processing methods, and core algorithms that power the application's financial tracking and budgeting capabilities. This analysis documents the key components of the business logic, their functions, and the business rules that govern the app's behavior.

## 2. Core Business Logic Components

### 2.1 Currency Management

The app implements sophisticated currency handling through `currencyFunctions.dart`, which provides:

- **Currency Conversion**: Functions like `amountRatioToPrimaryCurrency` and `amountRatioFromToCurrency` handle currency conversions between different wallet currencies.
- **Exchange Rate Fetching**: The `getExchangeRates` function retrieves current exchange rates from an external API and caches them for offline use.
- **Currency Formatting**: Functions for formatting currency values according to locale-specific conventions.

These functions enable the app to handle multi-currency wallets and provide accurate financial calculations across different currencies.

### 2.2 Spending Analysis

The `spendingSummaryHelper.dart` file implements the core logic for analyzing user spending patterns:

- **Category-based Spending Analysis**: The `TotalSpentCategoriesSummary` class and `watchTotalSpentInTimeRangeHelper` function analyze spending across different categories.
- **Hierarchical Category Management**: Logic for handling main categories and subcategories, including aggregation of spending data.
- **Data Transformation**: Methods for transforming raw transaction data into meaningful spending summaries.

This component is crucial for providing users with insights into their spending habits and financial patterns.

### 2.3 Recurring Transactions Management

The `upcomingTransactionsFunctions.dart` file handles the logic for recurring transactions and subscriptions:

- **Subscription Creation**: The `createNewSubscriptionTransaction` function manages the creation of future transactions based on subscription parameters.
- **Recurrence Calculation**: Logic for calculating the next occurrence date based on different recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
- **End Condition Handling**: Mechanisms for handling subscription end conditions, including end dates and goal achievement.

This functionality allows users to automate recurring financial events and maintain accurate financial forecasts.

### 2.4 Data Synchronization

The `syncClient.dart` file implements the logic for synchronizing data across devices:

- **Backup Creation**: The `createSyncBackup` function manages the creation of synchronized backups.
- **Device Identification**: Functions like `getCurrentDeviceSyncBackupFileName` and `getDeviceFromSyncBackupFileName` handle device-specific backup naming.
- **Sync Timing Management**: Logic for tracking and managing synchronization timing between devices.

This component ensures data consistency across multiple devices and provides data recovery capabilities.

### 2.5 Settings Management

The `settings.dart` file manages application settings and preferences:

- **Settings Initialization**: The `initializeSettings` function loads and initializes application settings.
- **Settings Migration**: Functions like `attemptToMigrateCyclePreferences` handle the migration of settings between app versions.
- **Settings Update**: The `updateSettings` function manages the updating of settings while maintaining consistency.

This component provides a flexible configuration system that adapts to user preferences and device capabilities.

### 2.6 Budget Sharing

The `shareBudget.dart` file implements the logic for collaborative budgeting:

- **Budget Sharing**: The `shareBudget` function handles the sharing of budgets with other users.
- **Shared Budget Management**: Functions for managing shared budget memberships and permissions.
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Logic for synchronizing shared budget data with Firebase.

This functionality enables collaborative financial planning and shared expense tracking.

## 3. Key Data Processing Functions

### 3.1 Financial Calculations

- **Currency Conversion**: Functions for converting amounts between different currencies based on current exchange rates.
- **Budget Allocation**: Algorithms for calculating budget allocations across different time periods and categories.
- **Spending Analysis**: Functions for analyzing spending patterns and generating financial insights.

### 3.2 Data Transformation

- **Category Aggregation**: Methods for aggregating transaction data by category and subcategory.
- **Time-based Grouping**: Functions for grouping financial data by different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
- **Data Normalization**: Algorithms for normalizing financial data for consistent analysis and presentation.

### 3.3 Data Synchronization

- **Change Detection**: Mechanisms for detecting and tracking changes to financial data.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Algorithms for resolving conflicts during data synchronization.
- **Backup Management**: Functions for creating, managing, and restoring data backups.

## 4. Key Algorithms

### 4.1 Recurring Transaction Generation

The app uses sophisticated algorithms to generate recurring transactions based on various parameters:

- **Date Calculation**: Algorithms for calculating future transaction dates based on recurrence patterns.
- **End Condition Evaluation**: Logic for evaluating end conditions for recurring transactions, including end dates and goal achievement.
- **Notification Scheduling**: Algorithms for scheduling notifications for upcoming transactions.

### 4.2 Spending Analysis

The app employs algorithms for analyzing spending patterns and providing financial insights:

- **Category-based Analysis**: Algorithms for analyzing spending by category and subcategory.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Methods for analyzing spending trends over different time periods.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Logic for identifying unusual spending patterns and potential budget issues.

### 4.3 Budget Allocation

The app uses algorithms for allocating budgets across different categories and time periods:

- **Period-based Allocation**: Logic for allocating budget amounts across different time periods based on recurrence patterns.
- **Category-based Allocation**: Algorithms for distributing budget amounts across different spending categories.
- **Progress Tracking**: Methods for tracking budget utilization and remaining amounts.

## 5. Business Rules and Constraints

### 5.1 Transaction Rules

- **Transaction Validation**: Rules for validating transaction data, including amount, date, and category requirements.
- **Recurring Transaction Rules**: Constraints governing the creation and management of recurring transactions.
- **Transaction Categorization**: Rules for categorizing transactions and managing category hierarchies.

### 5.2 Budget Rules

- **Budget Creation**: Rules for creating and configuring budgets, including amount, period, and category constraints.
- **Budget Sharing**: Constraints governing the sharing of budgets with other users.
- **Budget Tracking**: Rules for tracking budget utilization and generating alerts for potential overruns.

### 5.3 Data Integrity Rules

- **Currency Consistency**: Rules ensuring consistent currency handling across different parts of the application.
- **Data Synchronization**: Constraints governing the synchronization of data between devices and with cloud services.
- **Backup Management**: Rules for creating, managing, and restoring data backups.

### 5.4 Default Categories

The app defines a set of default transaction categories in `defaultCategories.dart`, which establishes:

- **Category Structure**: Predefined categories with specific attributes (name, color, icon).
- **Category Hierarchy**: Relationships between main categories and subcategories.
- **Category Purpose**: Designation of categories for income or expense transactions.

## 6. Conclusion

The business logic of the Cashew app is implemented through a well-organized collection of utility functions, data processing methods, and core algorithms in the `struct` directory. These components work together to provide a comprehensive financial tracking and budgeting solution with sophisticated features like multi-currency support, recurring transactions, collaborative budgeting, and cross-device synchronization.

The app's business logic is governed by a set of well-defined rules and constraints that ensure data integrity, consistent behavior, and a seamless user experience across different devices and usage scenarios.

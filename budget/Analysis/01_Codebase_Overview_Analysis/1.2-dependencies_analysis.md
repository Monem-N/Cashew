## 3. Custom and Modified Packages

The Cashew app uses two custom modified packages that are included directly in the project:

### 3.1 sliding_sheet (v0.5.2-modified)

**Original Package**: [sliding_sheet](https://github.com/bxqm/sliding_sheet) v0.5.2

**Purpose**: A widget that can be dragged and scrolled in a single gesture and snapped to a list of extents.

**Modifications**: Custom modifications to adapt the package to the specific needs of the Cashew app.

### 3.2 implicitly_animated_reorderable_list (v0.4.2-modified)

**Original Package**: [implicitly_animated_reorderable_list](https://github.com/BendixMa/implicitly_animated_reorderable_list) v0.4.2

**Purpose**: A Flutter ListView that implicitly animates between the changes of two lists with support for reordering items.

**Modifications**: Custom modifications to enhance functionality or fix issues for the Cashew app's specific requirements.

## 4. Version Constraints and Compatibility

### 4.1 Dart SDK Constraint

The app requires Dart SDK version 3.0.0 or higher:
```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">= 3.0.0"
```

### 4.2 Dependency Version Strategy

The Cashew app uses caret version constraints (^) for most dependencies, which allows for compatible updates within the same major version. This approach balances stability with the ability to receive bug fixes and minor improvements.

### 4.3 Custom Package Dependencies

The modified packages have their own version constraints:

- **implicitly_animated_reorderable_list**: Requires Dart SDK '>=2.12.0 <3.0.0'
- **sliding_sheet**: Requires Dart SDK '>=2.12.0 <3.0.0'

These constraints indicate that the modified packages are using Dart's null safety features (introduced in Dart 2.12) but have not been updated for Dart 3.0.

### 4.4 Development Dependencies

The app uses the following development dependencies:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|--------|
| drift_dev | ^2.14.0 | Development tools for Drift database |
| build_runner | ^2.4.7 | Code generation tool for Flutter/Dart |

## 5. Dependency Management Recommendations

1. **Update Modified Packages**: Consider updating the modified packages to support Dart 3.0+ to align with the main app's SDK requirements.

2. **Version Pinning**: For critical dependencies, consider pinning exact versions to prevent unexpected changes.

3. **Dependency Auditing**: Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities and updates.

4. **Consolidation**: Look for opportunities to consolidate dependencies with overlapping functionality.

5. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for features that rely heavily on external dependencies to quickly identify issues after dependency updates.

## 6. Conclusion

The Cashew app has a comprehensive set of dependencies that provide a wide range of functionality from UI components to database management and platform integration. The app maintains a balance between using established packages and customizing specific libraries to meet its unique requirements. The version constraints are generally flexible within major versions, allowing for bug fixes and improvements while maintaining stability.

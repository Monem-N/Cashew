## Resource Utilization

This document analyzes the resource utilization of the Cashew app, covering asset management, battery usage, and network usage.

#### Asset Management and Optimization

The Cashew app utilizes a significant number of PNG images, primarily for category icons. These images are stored in the `budget/assets/categories/` directory.  The app uses `AssetImage` to load these images, which is the standard approach in Flutter.

The following files are relevant to image asset management:

- `budget/lib/struct/defaultCategories.dart`: Defines default categories and their associated icon image files.
- `budget/lib/struct/iconObjects.dart`: Contains a comprehensive list of all category icons, referencing the PNG files.
- `budget/lib/widgets/noResults.dart`:  Displays specific images for "no results" states.
- `budget/lib/pages/onBoardingPage.dart`: Loads images for the app's onboarding screens.

**Potential Optimization:**

Currently, there's no evidence of image optimization techniques such as resizing, compression, or using a more efficient image format like WebP. Implementing these could significantly reduce the app's size and improve loading times, especially on lower-end devices or slower networks.

#### Battery and Network Usage Optimization

The app heavily relies on Firebase for data synchronization and uses asynchronous operations extensively. This can impact battery and network usage.

**Key Observations:**

-   **Firebase Integration:** The app uses Firebase for data synchronization (e.g., `budget/lib/main.dart`, `budget/lib/pages/aboutPage.dart`). Firebase handles background syncing, which can affect battery life.
-   **Background Operations:** Asynchronous operations (`async`, `await`, `Future.delayed`) are used throughout the codebase, potentially indicating background tasks.
-   **Shared Preferences:** Local storage with `sharedPreferences` is used (e.g., `budget/lib/pages/billSplitter.dart`), which is generally good for battery life.
-   **Network Requests:** The app fetches exchange rates from an external API (`budget/lib/pages/aboutPage.dart`), impacting network usage.
-   **Data Synchronization:** Frequent database operations and synchronization are observed, suggesting potential for optimization.
-  **High Refresh Rate:** `budget/lib/main.dart` sets a high refresh rate on app resume, which may increase battery consumption.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

-   **Frequent Data Synchronization:** Frequent database operations and synchronization could lead to increased network usage and battery drain.
-   **Firebase Usage:** Over-reliance on Firebase without optimized data synchronization strategies could cause performance issues.
-   **High Refresh Rate:** Setting a high refresh rate on app resume can negatively impact battery life.

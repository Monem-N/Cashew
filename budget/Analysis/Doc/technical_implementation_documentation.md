# Technical Implementation Documentation for Cashew Application

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Cashew application, its purpose, and its target audience.

## Project Structure Overview
- Document the overall project organization, including the directory hierarchy and the purpose of each component.
- Include a visual representation of the project structure (see `project_structure_diagram.md`).
- Include a visual representation of the project structure.

## Core Technologies
- **Language**: Dart
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **UI**: Flutter Material Design, custom widgets
- **State Management**: `provider`, `shared_preferences`
- **Database**: `drift` (local SQLite database), `cloud_firestore` (Firebase)
- **Authentication**: `firebase_auth`, `google_sign_in`, `local_auth`
- **Internationalization**: `easy_localization`
- **Notifications**: `flutter_local_notifications`, `notification_listener_service`

## Application Architecture
The Cashew application is built using the Flutter framework, which allows for cross-platform development. The architecture follows a modular design, separating concerns into distinct components.

### Main Components
- **Main Application Entry**: The application starts at `lib/main.dart`, which initializes Firebase, localization, and the database connection.
- **Pages**: The UI is organized into various pages located in the `lib/pages/` directory, each representing a different feature of the application (e.g., budget management, transaction tracking).
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components are stored in the `lib/widgets/` directory, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Business Logic**: Core business logic is encapsulated in the `lib/struct/` directory, handling data processing and application rules.
- **Database**: The `lib/database/` directory contains the database models and queries, utilizing Drift for local data storage.

### Navigation System
The application employs a custom navigation system that utilizes a sidebar for easy access to different sections. Users can navigate between pages using the `NavigationSidebar` component, which allows for a seamless user experience. The navigation structure supports nested routes, enabling users to drill down into specific features while maintaining context.

### User Interaction
Users interact with the application through various UI components, such as buttons, forms, and charts. The application responds to user inputs by updating the state and rendering the appropriate UI elements. Data is persisted locally and synchronized with Firebase, ensuring that user actions are reflected across devices.

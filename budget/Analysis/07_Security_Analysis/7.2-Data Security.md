# Data Security Analysis

This document analyzes the data security aspects of the Cashew app, covering data encryption, secure storage, sensitive data handling, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Data Encryption

- **Firebase Firestore:** Data stored in Firestore is encrypted in transit and at rest by Google Cloud.
- **`sharedPreferences`:** Data stored in `sharedPreferences` is not encrypted by default on Android. On iOS, it may be encrypted if the device has a passcode enabled.
- **In-App Encryption:** There is no explicit mention of custom encryption mechanisms within the app's code.

## Secure Storage Mechanisms

- **Firebase Authentication:** The app uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage user accounts.
- **`sharedPreferences`:** Used for storing non-sensitive settings and data.
- **Biometric Authentication:** The app offers an option to lock the app using biometrics, leveraging the device's secure enclave or trusted execution environment.

## Sensitive Data Handling

- **User Credentials:** User credentials (email, password) are managed by Firebase Authentication.
- **Financial Data:** Financial data (transactions, budgets, etc.) is stored in Firestore.
- **`sharedPreferences`:** Used to store user preferences, settings, and some local data (e.g., bill splitter information).

## Potential Security Vulnerabilities

- **`sharedPreferences`:** Storing sensitive data in `sharedPreferences` without additional encryption could be a vulnerability, especially on rooted or jailbroken devices.
- **Firebase Security Rules:** Improperly configured Firebase security rules could allow unauthorized access to user data. It is crucial to review and tighten these rules.
- **Data Synchronization:** The app's data synchronization mechanisms could be a potential attack vector if not implemented securely.

**Recommendations:**

- **Review and Strengthen Firebase Security Rules:** Ensure that Firebase security rules are properly configured to restrict access to user data based on authentication and authorization.
- **Consider Encrypting Sensitive Data in `sharedPreferences`:** Implement additional encryption for sensitive data stored locally, especially on Android.
- **Audit Data Synchronization:** Thoroughly review the data synchronization mechanisms to identify and address any potential security weaknesses.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

# Data Access Layer Analysis

## 1. Database Access Patterns

### 1.1 Global Database Access
The application uses a global database instance (`FinanceDatabase`) accessible through `databaseGlobal.dart`, ensuring consistent database access across the application. The database is initialized with default data through `initializeDefaultDatabase.dart`.

### 1.2 Type-Safe Access
The application uses Drift ORM (formerly Moor) for type-safe database access, with generated code handling the SQL operations (`tables.g.dart`).

### 1.3 Common Access Patterns
- Direct table access through generated DAO classes
- Type-safe query builders for complex queries
- Custom type converters for complex data types (e.g., Lists, Enums)
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency

## 2. CRUD Operations by Entity

### 2.1 Wallets
- Create/Update: `createOrUpdateWallet` method with UUID generation
- Read: `getAllWallets`, `getWallet` methods
- Delete: Soft deletion with `deleteLogPk` tracking
- Additional: Order management, currency formatting, and widget display settings

### 2.2 Transactions
- Create/Update: Transaction creation with paired transaction support
- Read: Complex filtering with multiple parameters (date, category, wallet)
- Delete: Soft deletion with cascade effects on related entities
- Special Features:
  - Reoccurrence handling
  - Subscription management
  - Credit/Debt tracking
  - Sharing capabilities

### 2.3 Categories
- Create/Update: Hierarchical category management (main/sub-categories)
- Read: Category retrieval with ordering support
- Delete: Soft deletion with impact tracking on transactions
- Features: Income/Expense categorization, emoji support

### 2.4 Budgets and Limits
- Create/Update: Budget creation with category limits
- Read: Budget queries with category aggregation
- Delete: Cascading deletion handling
- Features: Period-based budget tracking

## 3. Query Optimization

### 3.1 Performance Considerations
- Default query limits (100,000 records)
- Indexed primary keys (UUID-based)
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Batch operations for bulk updates

### 3.2 Query Optimization Techniques
- Selective column loading
- Indexed foreign key relationships
- Efficient date-based filtering
- Smart label matching for transaction categorization

## 4. Data Migration Strategies

### 4.1 Schema Evolution
- Version-controlled schema updates (v33 to v46)
- Drift's migration system for schema changes
- Backward compatibility maintenance

### 4.2 Migration Features
- Type-safe schema updates
- Data transformation during migration
- Rollback support
- Version tracking in schema_versions.dart

## 5. Special Considerations

### 5.1 Data Integrity
- Character limits enforcement (NAME_LIMIT: 250, NOTE_LIMIT: 500)
- Foreign key constraints
- Soft deletion for data recovery
- Transaction-based operations

### 5.2 Cross-Platform Support
- Platform-specific database implementations
- Consistent data access patterns across platforms
- Shared database interface

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Performance Improvements
- Implement query result caching
- Add index optimization for frequently accessed fields
- Consider implementing batch operations for bulk updates

### 6.2 Maintainability Enhancements
- Add comprehensive database logging
- Implement query performance monitoring
- Create database health check utilities

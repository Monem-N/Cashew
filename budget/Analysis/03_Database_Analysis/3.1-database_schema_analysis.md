# Cashew App Database Schema Analysis

## 1. Database Overview

The Cashew app uses a SQLite database managed through the Drift ORM (formerly Moor) for local data storage. The database schema is defined in the `tables.dart` file and has evolved through multiple versions, with schema migration files stored in the `drift_schemas` directory (from v33 to v46).

## 2. Core Database Tables

The database consists of the following primary tables:

### 2.6 AssociatedTitles (`associated_titles`)

Stores transaction title patterns associated with specific categories for automatic categorization.

**Key Fields:**
- `associatedTitlePk`: Primary key (UUID)

### 2.7 Objectives (`objectives`)

Stores financial goals and loans.

**Key Fields:**
- Fields not fully visible in the examined code, but referenced by transactions

### 2.8 AppSettings (`app_settings`)

Stores application settings as JSON.

**Key Fields:**
- `settingsPk`: Primary key (auto-increment integer)
- `settingsJSON`: JSON string containing settings
- `dateUpdated`: Last update timestamp

### 2.9 ScannerTemplates (`scanner_templates`)

Stores templates for scanning and parsing receipts or financial documents.

**Key Fields:**
- `scannerTemplatePk`: Primary key (UUID)
- `templateName`: Template name
- Various fields for pattern matching and extraction rules

### 2.10 DeleteLogs (`delete_logs`)

Tracks deletion of records for synchronization purposes.

**Key Fields:**
- `deleteLogPk`: Primary key (UUID)
- `entryPk`: Primary key of the deleted entry
- `type`: Type of deleted entity
- `dateTimeModified`: Deletion timestamp

## 3. Database Relationships

### 3.1 One-to-Many Relationships

- **Category to Subcategories**: Main categories can have multiple subcategories through the self-referential `mainCategoryPk` field.
- **Wallet to Transactions**: A wallet can have multiple transactions through the `walletFk` field.
- **Category to Transactions**: A category can be associated with multiple transactions through the `categoryFk` field.
- **Budget to CategoryBudgetLimits**: A budget can have multiple category-specific limits.

### 3.2 Many-to-Many Relationships

- **Budgets to Categories**: Implemented through lists stored as JSON strings (`categoryFks` and `categoryFksExclude`).
- **Budgets to Wallets**: Implemented through lists stored as JSON strings (`walletFks`).

### 3.3 Special Relationships

- **Paired Transactions**: Transactions can be paired through the `pairedTransactionFk` field for transfers between accounts.
- **Transactions to Objectives**: Transactions can be linked to financial objectives.

## 4. Schema Evolution

The database schema has evolved from version 33 to the current version 46, with each version documented in the `drift_schemas` directory. Key evolution points include:

- Addition of new tables and fields to support new features
- Modifications to existing tables to support enhanced functionality
- Changes in data types and constraints
- Support for sharing and synchronization features

The migration process is managed through Drift's versioned schema system, with each version defined in the `schema_versions.dart` file.

## 5. Data Integrity Constraints

### 5.1 Primary Keys

- Most tables use UUID-based primary keys generated using `uuid.v4()`
- The `AppSettings` table uses an auto-incrementing integer primary key

### 5.2 Foreign Keys

- Explicit foreign key constraints between related tables
- Self-referential foreign key in the Categories table for subcategories

### 5.3 Text Length Constraints

- `NAME_LIMIT`: 250 characters for names
- `NOTE_LIMIT`: 500 characters for notes
- `COLOUR_LIMIT`: 50 characters for color values

### 5.4 Default Values

- Creation timestamps defaulting to current time
- Default currency decimals (2)
- Default wallet reference ("0")

### 5.5 Type Converters

The database uses several type converters to store complex data types in SQLite:

- `IntListInColumnConverter`: Converts lists of integers to/from JSON strings
- `StringListInColumnConverter`: Converts lists of strings to/from JSON strings
- `DoubleListInColumnConverter`: Converts lists of doubles to/from JSON strings
- `BudgetTransactionFiltersListInColumnConverter`: Converts lists of enum values to/from JSON strings
- `HomePageWidgetDisplayListInColumnConverter`: Converts lists of enum values to/from JSON strings

## 6. Mapping to Application Models

The database entities map directly to Dart classes through the Drift ORM:

- Database tables are defined as classes extending `Table`
- Each table has a corresponding data class (e.g., `TransactionWallet`, `Transaction`, `Budget`)
- The generated code in `tables.g.dart` provides mapping between database rows and Dart objects
- Enums are used extensively to represent categorical data (e.g., `BudgetReoccurence`, `TransactionSpecialType`, `ObjectiveType`)

## 7. Validation Rules

- Field length validation through the Drift ORM
- Type validation through the Drift ORM
- Custom validation logic in the application code
- Enum-based constraints for categorical data

## 8. Conclusion

The Cashew app uses a well-structured relational database with clear entity relationships. The schema has evolved significantly over time, with careful migration management. The use of UUIDs, foreign keys, and type converters ensures data integrity while supporting complex data structures. The direct mapping between database entities and application models through the Drift ORM provides a clean and type-safe data access layer.
